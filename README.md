# Algorithm-sort
# Overview
Welcome to the Sorting Algorithms Visualization project! This UI-based tool is designed to help you understand and visualize how different sorting algorithms work. The application demonstrates execution of the following sorting algorithms:

  1. Bubble Sort <br>
  2. Merge Sort <br>
  3. Selection Sort <br>
  4. Insertion Sort <br>
  5. Heap Sort <br>
  6. Quick Sort <br>
    
# Features

  * **Interactive Visualizations**: Watch the algorithms sort data in real-time, with visual highlights showing key operations such as comparisons, swaps, and merges.
  * **Step-by-Step Execution**: Control the pace of the algorithm execution and the size of the array using the cursor on the UI.

# Getting Started 
## Installation
1.Clone the Repo to your local Machine -
